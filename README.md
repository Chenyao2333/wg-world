# üï∏Ô∏èwg-mesh

A mesh network configurator based on [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/).

## üìöQuick Start

`wg-mesh` configurator only works on Linux. Clone this project and run `thirdpary.py` to install the necessary dependencies. Note `thirdpart.py` only works on Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems, try to port it if you are running on other systems.

See `example.py` for the example configuration. In `example.py`, it configures two router nodes `bj` and `hk`, and a few clients. `wg-mesh` is based on Wireguard to build the P2P tunnel. So it needs to read and manage the Wireguard credentials. Run `./exmaple.py genkey all` to generate keys for all hosts. The generated keys will be in the `keys` directory.

To set up the mesh network in the real environment, you have to sync the keys generated before to all hosts and then run `./example.py up HOST_NAME` on the corresponding host. For the non-Linux client which cannot be configured by this script, it can use the standard Wrieguard clients with the configuration generated by `./example.py gen-client-conf HOST_NAME`.

## ü§°Mock Network

Debug the network configuration in the real environment is inconvenient. Thus, `wg-mesh` provides a way to generate a local mock network based on [network namespaces](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/09/04/introducing-linux-network-namespaces/):

```
./exmaple.py mock
```

You can explore it by using `sudo ip netns HOST_NAME CMD` to run commands in the mock network. For example, you can ping the `bj` host, which IP is `10.56.1.1` in the example configuration, from the `hk` host:

```
sudo ip netns hk ping 10.56.1.1
```

## üßë‚ÄçüíªDevelopment

I track some TODO-s and thoughts in [wiki](https://github.com/louchenyao/wg-mesh/wiki).
